Coldfusion library for Kraken.io API
=========

Coldfusion component for working with the Kraken.io image optimization API. Learn more at http://kraken.io and https://github.com/kraken-io.

Differences from other Kraken.io API wrappers
---------------------------
The other API wrappers from Kraken.io use `url` and `request` as method names. These are reserved words in Coldfusion so I've used `uri` and `send` respectively.
